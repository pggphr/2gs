Add Inter variable font files here:

- Inter-roman.var.woff2
- Inter-italic.var.woff2

How to get them (quick):
1) Go to fonts.google.com -> Inter -> Download family.
2) Inside the download, look for variable WOFF2 files (or export to WOFF2).
3) Rename to the filenames above (or adjust urls in assets/site.css).
